This is a chatbot that I have developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is a web interface that can answer every question in the most human possible way and it is based on AI.
Error messages will pop up whenever there is an error with the API that I have linked with . The response is created using the fetch method that I have used to get the data from the API. The chatbot is able to answer every question that you ask it and it is able to understand the context of the question. It is also able to understand the tone of the question and it is able to respond accordingly.
The chatbot is able to understand the context of the question by using the Natural Language Processing (NLP). Upon typing your message, click on the send button to send your message.
